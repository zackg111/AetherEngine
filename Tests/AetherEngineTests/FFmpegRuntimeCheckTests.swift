/// AE#396 cost a downstream adopter five fixtures and two devices, and the defect was never in the
/// engine: their app linked a second FFmpeg (a static archive, `-force_load`ed, so its `avcodec_*`
/// became ordinary definitions in the executable and beat our dylib for every other object in the
/// same link). The engine expects libavcodec 62 and was executing against 61. The only trace it left
/// was `flac bridge encoder absent from this FFmpeg build` - a sentence about a build that was not
/// ours, and reads as a statement about ours.
///
/// The engine could not notice, because `avcodec_version` and `avcodec_configuration` appeared zero
/// times in `Sources/`. These tests pin the witness that closes that hole: what the headers said at
/// compile time against what the loaded binary answers at runtime.
///
/// The sharp one is `loadedLibrariesMatchTheHeadersThisBuildCompiledAgainst`. In a host with a
/// second FFmpeg ahead of ours in the link, that test is the one that fails.
