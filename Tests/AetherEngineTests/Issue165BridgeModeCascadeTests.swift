/// #165: on an FFmpeg build missing the bridge encoder the configured mode resolves to (e.g. no
/// --enable-encoder=eac3), `AudioBridge.init` throws `.encoderNotFound` and the single-attempt route dropped
/// straight to silent video-only. The fix cascades to the other encoder before giving up. These cover the
/// ordering decision in isolation; the encoder-absent runtime path itself can't be unit-tested because CI's
/// FFmpeg build carries both encoders (verified on hardware by the reporter).
///
/// AE#395 turned this from a MODE cascade into an ENCODER cascade. `.surroundCompat` resolves to FLAC for a
/// source with no surround to carry, so on a stereo source both modes name the same encoder and a mode list
/// would have retried the absent one against itself, landing on exactly the silent fallback #165 removed.
