// AE#377, the deciding measurement. The origin that opened the issue refuses new requests in windows
// that last minutes and recover on their own: seven of them inside a single episode. They are not on
// a clock, and cannot be provoked, so what a client meets is a refusal that arrives without notice
// and lasts longer than any read-ahead a device can hold. The only client shape that survives that
// is the one ffmpeg uses: one connection, held, consumed at playback rate. The engine cannot express that today because a URLSession data
// task has no flow-control contract (#174, #220: 911 MB still arriving after a suspend), and the
// reader therefore ends its connection at winHighWater (16 MB on VOD, #310).
//
// So there are two questions and one of them can kill the plan outright:
//
//   1. Does a HELD connection actually escape the refusal window, or does the origin cut it too?
//      If it gets cut, changing transports buys nothing and nobody should write that code.
//   2. Does URLSessionStreamTask, whose reads are demand-driven, stop the sender when we stop
//      reading, and does holding it across a viewer pause starve the process's networking the way
//      #310 measured for nw flows?
//
// A macOS loopback run answered neither, because the known-bad arm (data task + suspend) behaved
// there too. A harness in which the known failure looks healthy decides nothing. Hence: device,
// real origin, and the positive control in the same run as the question.
//
// Run it (Apple TV, on the same network the failures happen on). The URL goes in ProbeTarget.swift,
// because no environment channel reaches a test process on a tvOS destination, simulator included:
//
//   cd ../Device
//   xcodebuild test -project TransportProbe.xcodeproj -scheme TransportProbe \
//     -destination 'platform=tvOS,id=<device-udid>' \
//     -test-timeouts-enabled NO -allowProvisioningUpdates DEVELOPMENT_TEAM=<team>
//
// The arms are serialized and ordered; the whole set is about 20 minutes. With no URL configured the
// suite is disabled, which is why a bare run never touches the network.
