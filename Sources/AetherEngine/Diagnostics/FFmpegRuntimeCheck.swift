/// AetherEngine calls `avcodec_*` / `avformat_*` as ordinary external symbols, so which binary
/// serves them is decided by the host's link, not by the package graph. A second FFmpeg in the
/// executable wins wherever it sorts first: a static archive pulled in with `-force_load` becomes a
/// definition in the binary itself and beats every dylib, and a dependency that re-exports the same
/// symbols (libVLC does) wins whenever the build system lists it ahead of a vendored framework.
/// The engine then executes against headers it was never compiled against.
///
/// AE#396 was exactly that, and cost its reporter five fixtures and two devices, because the only
/// trace was `flac bridge encoder absent from this FFmpeg build`: a sentence about the build that
/// answered, which read as a sentence about ours. Nothing here fixes a bad link (nothing in a
/// library can), it only makes the first minute say so.
