# aetherctl

A standalone macOS CLI shipped alongside the library for repro work without going through TestFlight + Apple TV. Most subcommands operate on a media source URL (`file://` or `http(s)://`); `live`, `dvr`, `hlsfixture`, and `hlslive` run against built-in synthetic fixtures.

```bash
swift run aetherctl probe <url>          # dump container + streams + duration, exit
swift run aetherctl serve <url>          # park the engine's loopback HLS-fMP4 server

swift run aetherctl segverify <url>      # SW-decode each loopback segment in isolation; report independence (#92)
swift run aetherctl swdecode <url>       # open SoftwareVideoDecoder, decode N packets, report
swift run aetherctl play <url>           # full load+play session smoke test: 1 Hz telemetry, cue log, host-call mimicry

```

Twenty-one subcommands plus the bare-URL `serve` alias.

## probe

Opens the demuxer, prints the codec / resolution / frame rate of the video track, the audio track list (codec, channels, language, Atmos flag), the subtitle track list, the parsed container metadata (`MediaMetadata`: title / artist / album / albumArtist + embedded cover art presence), then exits. No HLS server is started.

## serve

The original behavior. The CLI prints the loopback URL and parks until Ctrl-C; from another terminal you can:

```bash
curl -i  http://127.0.0.1:<port>/master.m3u8
curl -o  /tmp/init.mp4   http://127.0.0.1:<port>/init.mp4
mediastreamvalidator http://127.0.0.1:<port>/master.m3u8
mp4dump --verbosity 1 /tmp/init.mp4
ffprobe -v debug /tmp/seg0.mp4
open 'http://127.0.0.1:<port>/master.m3u8'   # macOS QuickTime
```

`--no-dv` forces the SDR / HDR10 route even for a Dolby Vision source (compare the two playlists).

`--native-subs <index>` turns on the native WebVTT subtitle renditions (the `LoadOptions.prepareNativeSubtitles` path a full session uses): the engine calls `requestNativeSubtitleTrack()` before `start()`, then `attachAllNativeSubtitleStores()` after start. Every non-bitmap text track is served as a language-tagged `EXT-X-MEDIA:TYPE=SUBTITLES` rendition (`DEFAULT=NO,AUTOSELECT=NO`) in the master playlist, backed by a per-track `subs_N.m3u8` WebVTT media playlist. (An earlier design muxed `mov_text`/tx3g traks into the fMP4; in-band timed text is not HLS-conformant and AVPlayer rejected it, so the WebVTT rendition replaced it, see [formats.md › Native subtitle renditions](formats.md#native-subtitle-renditions-webvtt-for-pip-airplay-and-external-display).) The `<index>` value is legacy and now ignored, kept only for CLI compatibility: every non-bitmap track is always declared, and actual track selection happens via the host API in a full session, not from this flag. `curl` the `master.m3u8` (or open it in QuickTime) to verify the `SUBTITLES` group + `subs_N.m3u8` endpoints enumerate every language as a legible `AVMediaSelection` group. Omit the flag to reproduce the default behavior (no renditions, output identical to before).

`--throttle-kbps N` is a TEST-ONLY slow-CDN simulation: it caps source-IO delivery to N kbit/s. Set it below the stream bitrate to starve the producer below real-time and provoke AVPlayer rebuffers (for example the #92 open-GOP repro). Also available on `seektest` and `play`.

`--start-position S` starts the session at S seconds, the resume anchor a host passes to `load(url:startPosition:)`. Also available on `play`.

## validate

`serve` plus an inline `xcrun mediastreamvalidator` run against the loopback manifest, with the report printed and the engine torn down on completion.

## swdecode

Opens `SoftwareVideoDecoder` for the source's video stream, feeds up to N packets (default 100, override with `--frames N`), and reports counters plus first-frame metadata (pixel format, dimensions). Tests the SW-pipeline decode path end-to-end without needing a render layer. Useful for legacy codecs (MPEG-4 Part 2, MPEG-2, VC-1) and AV1 / VP9 on platforms where the native AVPlayer path doesn't accept them. Verdict distinguishes three failure modes:

- decoder open failed (FFmpegBuild gate or malformed extradata)
- decoder opened but no frames produced (pixel-format conversion, no IDR in window)
- SW decode end-to-end healthy (if real playback still hangs, the failure is downstream in `SoftwarePlaybackHost` frame-enqueue, display-layer attach, or audio-clock sync)

Backed by the public `AetherEngine.swDecodeProbe(url:maxPackets:options:)` static API returning `SoftwareDecodeProbeResult`. Hosts can use the same probe in their own diagnostic overlays.

## play

Runs a full `load()` + `play()` session exactly like a host app and prints 1 Hz transport telemetry (state, phase, currentTime, sourceTime, buffered frontier, duration) plus the network half of the same `liveTelemetry` snapshot a host reads (`net` throughput, `rx` reader lifetime pull, `ahead` fetched-but-unconsumed window, `cushion` decoded video past the clock, `fwd` native forward buffer, `drop` / `delay`). Fields absent on the running path are omitted, so a software session reads `cushion` where a native one reads `fwd`. Note that `drop` climbs steadily in a CLI run: nothing binds a render surface, and the renderer drops what it cannot present. Where `swdecode` proves the decoder, `play` proves the transport: it fails loud on the two silent failure modes of a session that "loads fine" but never actually plays (#107): exit 2 when the clock does not advance, exit 3 when a selected subtitle track produces no cues.

```bash
swift run aetherctl play <url>                                  # VOD load, 30 s telemetry
swift run aetherctl play --seconds 60 <url>                     # longer window
swift run aetherctl play --live --dvr-window 1800 <url>         # live path with a DVR ring
swift run aetherctl play --subs teletext <url>                  # activate the first matching subtitle track, log every cue + trim
swift run aetherctl play --host-calls reloadlive,play,extractor,setrate <url>   # mimic a host's post-load call sequence
swift run aetherctl play --live --dvr-window 1800 --audio-stats <url>           # decoded-PCM continuity + per-second audio lead
swift run aetherctl play --live --native-hls <master.m3u8>      # nativeRemoteHLS bypass (carriage watchdog + #293 probe)
swift run aetherctl play --sidecar de=/tmp/de.srt --subs de <master.m3u8>   # declare a sidecar at load (#316)
```

`--sidecar <lang>=<path-or-url>[,<lang>=<path>...]` fills `LoadOptions.externalSubtitles`, the load-time
declaration a host makes. On a remote `m3u8` this is what makes the engine stand up its rewritten master
(#316), so it is the way to see the whole chain from the CLI: the served `master.m3u8` body is logged, the
engine reports how many renditions it injected, and selecting the track (`--subs <lang>` matches the
external track by language) shows the `subs_N.m3u8` and `subs_N_0.vtt` fetches arriving. The end-of-run
`subtitle tracks` line is the settled list a host's picker would show, with `*` marking external ids; note
that `cues=0` and "no cues arrived" are CORRECT there, because AVPlayer renders a rendition itself and the
overlay pipeline stays empty (same as AE#154).

`--subs <codec-or-lang>` matches against the track's libavcodec name or language and logs every overlay cue and cue trim as it lands. `--host-calls` replays host post-load behavior against the fresh session: `play`, `extractor` (`makeFrameExtractor`), `setrate` (`setRate(1.0)`), `reloadlive` (reload the URL on the live path when the probe flags it live, the AetherPlayer Open URL flow), `seekback` (rewind 20 s into the DVR window at t=15, return to the live edge at t=30), and `overlapseek` (the #292 seek-window drills below); this is how the pre-arming `setRate` wedge was isolated.

`--seek-every N` seeks once every N ticks past tick 10, walking `--seek-pattern <abs,abs,...>` if one is given (a short backward hop otherwise), and `--seek-count K` stops after K seeks so a run can be a BURST and then play. Both halves are needed for anything about what a seek sequence leaves behind: the burst puts the store in the state under test, and only the playing half shows what the overlay carries through it. That pairing is what made AE#362's second mechanism reproducible (a hole between a restarted pump and the island the previous run left ahead of it, decoded across and then never re-read).

`--host-calls overlapseek` (pair it with `--sw`) runs three drills at t=8, each making a transport call while a seek's demuxer reposition is still in flight, which is the window #254 opened by moving that reposition off the main actor: **A** a second same-target seek (the #292 report: a scrub arriving as two seeks, the second superseding the first), **B** a `pause()`, **C** a `play()` from paused. `seektest` cannot reach any of this because it awaits every seek, so its bursts are strictly serial. Each drill heals the session with pause + play first, so a defect one drill provokes is not inherited by the next, and each reports its own PASS / FAIL / INCONCLUSIVE (`inWindow=NO` means the call arrived after the landing and the run proves nothing). Exit 4 when any drill fails, 5 when any is inconclusive. Before the #292 fix, A and C land the clock at `rate=0.0` while the engine reports `.playing` and B silently keeps playing through the pause.

`--live-ingest` loads the URL through `HLSLiveIngestReader` as a custom source, which is the shape a host uses for a live channel it ingests and re-serves itself (Sodalite's direct live path). Pair it with `--live`. It reaches the reader DIRECTLY, which is what a repro of the reader itself needs; since AE#363 plain `--live` also ends up there, but by way of the engine's own route (the raw live path detects the playlist and hands it to the ingest), so use `--live-ingest` when the reader is the subject and plain `--live` when the routing is. `hlslive` only serves local `.ts` files. AE#359 (the master's SUBTITLES renditions were parsed away) survived precisely because this path had no harness; `--live-ingest --subs <lang>` reproduces and verifies it in 40 s against a public broadcaster URL.

`--fast-zap` sets `LoadOptions.liveJoinProfile = .fastZap` for the load. `live` has carried the flag for its own raw-TS fixture since AE#195, but that fixture has no upstream playlist, and the served `#EXT-X-TARGETDURATION` is floored by the UPSTREAM's observed arrival cadence (`LiveCadencePolicy`), which is what sizes the holdback the first serve waits for. So fastZap against an origin of one's own, the shape a downstream player actually ships, could not be driven from here at all. Measured on the same 1 s-GOP seed, `--preroll 0 --realtime`: raw TS with no playlist serves at 1.325 s on TARGETDURATION 1 (holdback 3 s, full cushion), the same content behind an `hlsfixture` origin cutting 2 s segments serves on TARGETDURATION **2** (holdback 6 s) although the engine re-cut it at 1 s. Pair it with `--live`, and read the first-serve line (AE#374) rather than a first-frame stopwatch.

`--header "Name: Value"` (repeatable) fills `LoadOptions.httpHeaders` and, on `--live-ingest`, the reader's own fetches. Origins that enforce a per-request `User-Agent` / `Referer` / `Authorization` (tokenized IPTV, STB profiles) could not be driven from the CLI at all before AE#363; pair it with `hlsfixture --require-header` below to have both ends of the contract in one run.

`--native-hls` sets `LoadOptions.nativeRemoteHLS`, the path a host uses for a live channel AVPlayer can play itself. It is the only way to exercise the #168 carriage watchdog, the #293 carriage probe and the AE#363 origin-refusal reroute from the CLI (`hlslive` loads the ingest reader directly and never mounts natively). Pair it with `--live`; without that the m3u8 takes the raw live path, which since AE#363 routes it onto the ingest instead of mounting AVPlayer at all.

`--switch-audio <index>[@ms]` replays a host applying a viewer's language preference just after playback starts (default +20 ms, the #337 field case): the engine rebuilds the session with the new stream at `resumeAt = 0`, which is the only shape where the rebuilt session's video renderer can fill before the newly selected stream's first packet arrives. Pick a stream whose first packet sits late in the mux and the run before the fix reads `state=playing cur=0.00` for its whole length with a first frame on screen; the end-of-run verdict names it. `--audio-stats` alongside it re-installs the tap after the switch, because the tap is bound to the software host the switch replaces and would otherwise report silence for a session that is playing fine. Build a fixture with a late track by offsetting one input: `ffmpeg -f lavfi -i testsrc2=size=1280x720:rate=30:duration=40 -f lavfi -i sine=frequency=440:duration=40 -itsoffset 12 -f lavfi -i sine=frequency=660:duration=28 -map 0:v -map 1:a -map 2:a -c:v libx264 -c:a libopus late-audio.mkv`.

`--teletext-page N` sets `LoadOptions.teletextPage` for the load, and `--switch-teletext-page <page|auto>[@ms]` changes it on a channel that is already playing (default +20 s, deliberately long: the switch has to land after `--subs` has a teletext track showing, else the run measures the load option it could already measure). The engine states what the change reached, `re-decoding N channel(s)` or `no active teletext track to re-decode`, so a page that does nothing is distinguishable from a page that never arrived. Real teletext needs a broadcast transport stream; there is no way to synthesise one with ffmpeg, so the CLI check covers the wiring and the gate, and the decode itself is confirmed against a live DVB channel (#364).

`--frame-times` installs the #311 software frame-time observer BEFORE `load()` (the documented usage: the engine re-arms each new host with it) and reads `softwarePresentationTimebase`. Per tick it appends `ft` (frames reported since the last tick), `ftLast` (newest reported presentation time), `ftGen` (renderer flush generation, which a seek moves) and `ooo`, the count of reports that arrived out of presentation order. `ooo` is the API's own claim under test: these are reported past the reorder buffer, so it must stay 0. `tb` is the timebase read at the same instant, and its closeness to `ftLast` is the point, both are on the source axis with nothing to convert between them.

`--sequential-origin` declares `LoadOptions.sequentialOrigin`, the IPTV timeshift / catch-up shape whose `206` answers are fabricated (#346): one long-lived unranged GET, no ranged probes, no tail read, so **seeking is unavailable** in the run. On VOD it needs `--declared-duration S`, which fills `LoadOptions.declaredDurationSeconds`, because the estimate that the tail read would have produced is gone with the tail read.

`--start-position S` starts at a resume anchor, the same one `serve` takes. `--sw` forces the software path for a source that would route native, which is how a native-only fixture exercises the SW pipeline.

`--malloc-census` turns on the large-allocation census (`AetherEngine.setLargeAllocationCensusEnabled`) for the run, for tracing a footprint that grows where the segment budget says it should not. Besides the 30 s sample it arms a jump trigger, which exists because the 30 s memprobe cannot catch a failure that completes inside one sample (every kill on #220 was that shape): a counter polled at `--census-hz N` runs the zone walk once it climbs `--census-threshold-mb N` above its running high-water. Both flags are inert without `--malloc-census`.

`--audio-stats` installs the engine audio tap and watches the decoded PCM itself: an `AGAP` line for every source-PTS discontinuity > 2 ms between consecutive buffers, and per-second `alead` (last decoded audio PTS minus the synchronizer clock) plus `abufs` (buffers delivered) appended to the telemetry. `alead` is the audio renderer's safety margin: on the SW live path the look-ahead pump holds it near `AudioLookaheadPolicy.targetLeadSeconds`; a collapse toward zero means the source or the feeder cannot keep real time (this is how the #107 audio-chopping report was diagnosed).

## segverify

Fetches `init.mp4` and then each media segment in turn from the loopback server and SW-decodes each segment **in isolation** (a fresh decoder per segment, no carried reference frames), reporting how many are independently decodable. A segment that yields `framesDecoded == 0` is not self-contained: its first sample is not an IRAP, so it depends on a predecessor, which is the open-GOP / B-frame boundary defect (#92). `--from N` / `--count K` bound the range (default 0 / 12), `--no-dv` forces the SDR route, `--dump <dir>` writes each fetched segment for offline inspection. Exit 0 when every tested segment is independent, 2 when any is not. This is the ground-truth verifier the #92 fix was validated against (ffmpeg's `hls` muxer scores every segment independent).

## dovitest

Runs the Dolby Vision Profile 7 to 8.1 converter over every video packet of the source and writes the converted elementary stream (Annex B) to `/tmp/aetherctl-dovitest.hevc`, reporting packets processed, conversions, and failures. Lets you confirm the in-engine `DoviRpuConverter` (libdovi) output matches the `dovi_tool -m 2` ground truth offline, without a DV panel:

```bash
swift run aetherctl dovitest <p7-source>
dovi_tool extract-rpu -i /tmp/aetherctl-dovitest.hevc -o out.rpu
dovi_tool info -i out.rpu -f 0   # expect dovi_profile 8, disable_residual_flag true
```

## pktdump

Opens the demuxer under a selectable open profile, optionally seeks, and dumps raw video packet timing exactly as the demuxer delivers it (before any producer-side dts repair and before muxing): per-packet dts / pts / duration / keyframe flag samples, NOPTS and non-monotonic dts counts, and dts-delta / duration histograms. Also prints the resolved stream fields that `find_stream_info` fills (`avg_frame_rate`, `codecpar.video_delay`).

```bash
swift run aetherctl pktdump --at 660 --count 300 --profile playback        <url>
swift run aetherctl pktdump --at 660 --count 300 --profile restartReopen   <url>
swift run aetherctl pktdump --at 660 --count 300 --profile stillExtraction <url>
```

`--profile` defaults to `playback`; `stillExtraction` is the third open profile, the one the `FrameExtractor` uses (a short-range AVIO with its own thread count), for comparing what a still-extraction open resolves against what playback resolves.

The profile differential is the diagnostic: a `video_delay=0` plus NOPTS or non-monotonic dts under one profile while the other is clean means that profile's open path cannot reconstruct decode-order dts for B-frame content (the #93 post-recovery judder root cause). Backed by the public `PacketTimingProbe.run(url:seekSeconds:packetCount:profileName:)`.

## extract

Opens a `FrameExtractor` against the source and pulls a still frame. Thumbnail mode (default) snaps to the nearest keyframe and downscales to `--width` (default 320); `--snapshot` decodes frame-accurately at full resolution. `--at <sec>` sets the seek position (default 60.0). The first frame is written to `/tmp/aetherctl-extract-<mode>.png`. `--loops N` repeats the extraction across eight cycling positions, which pairs with `leaks --atExit` to validate the decode-context teardown is clean:

```bash
swift run aetherctl extract --at 612 --snapshot <url>          # frame-accurate still
swift run aetherctl extract --width 480 <url>                  # keyframe thumbnail
leaks --atExit -- .build/debug/aetherctl extract --loops 8 <url>   # leak sweep
```

## audio

Plays a source through the audio-only pipeline (default ten seconds, `--seconds N` to override) and reports which host took it (bare AVPlayer vs the FFmpeg renderer path), exercising the same dispatch a music host sees.

## audiotap

    aetherctl audiotap [--duration S] [--out PATH.wav] [--remote | --software] <url>

Brings up the loopback session headless, decodes the audio tap (#95) as fast as segments are produced, writes mono Float32 48 kHz WAV (default `/tmp/audiotap.wav`), and prints buffer count, PCM seconds, discontinuity count, and the covered `sourceTime` span. A clean run reports exactly one discontinuity (the install itself). `--remote` drives the remote-HLS delivery path instead (direct AVPlayer ingest of an HLS url, no loopback): rendition/variant resolution, segment fetch + decrypt, playhead-follow decode. Verification tool for the PCM audio tap across the stream-copy and bridge audio paths.

`--software` drives the third delivery path, the SW sink (`AudioTapPCMConverter`), which the other two modes cannot reach: they drive their readers directly, while the sink only exists inside a real session. This mode therefore loads the source through the whole engine, fails if it did not route to the software host, installs the tap through the public `installAudioTap()` and plays, so the sink runs exactly as it does in a host. It is bound to wall clock (the SW host decodes in real time), and it reports `peak` next to the buffer count because the two ways this path fails look identical in a report otherwise: **exit 3 covers both no buffers at all and buffers of digital silence**, which at a consumer is indistinguishable from a muted source. That gap is not hypothetical. With no harness here, a force unwrap that trapped on the FIRST buffer of any multichannel track shipped in 6.1.3 and survived to main (#400), and the silent-downmix defect underneath it only became visible once the trap was gone. Software routing needs a source the native path declines, e.g. `ffmpeg -f lavfi -i testsrc2 -f lavfi -i sine -c:v libvpx-vp9 -c:a aac -shortest clip.mkv`; add `-af "pan=5.1|c0=c0|c1=c0|c2=c0|c3=c0|c4=c0|c5=c0"` for the multichannel case and `-af "pan=quad|c0=c0|c1=c0|c2=c0|c3=c0"` for the layout AVAudioConverter refuses to mix.

## bgaudio

Verifies SW-path background audio (iOS keepalive) headless on macOS, where the `UIApplication` background lifecycle that normally drives it does not exist. Loads a software-routed source through the full engine, plays a foreground baseline, toggles the SW host into background-audio-only (`--fg N` foreground seconds, `--bg N` background seconds; defaults 3 / 6), then returns to foreground. Reports per-tick the audio clock, the SW video-frame count, and the process memory footprint, and a verdict. A healthy run shows the clock advancing through the background phase (audio alive), the video-frame count flat (video dropped), the footprint roughly flat (the loop paces on the audio renderer rather than buffering the rest of the file), and the video-frame count rising again on foreground return (resync at the next keyframe). The flag and counters are exposed through DEBUG-only engine hooks, so this command is unavailable in a Release build. Generate a quick software-path clip with `ffmpeg -f lavfi -i testsrc2 -f lavfi -i sine -c:v libvpx-vp9 -c:a aac -shortest clip.mkv`.

## customio

Wraps a local file in a custom `IOReader` and plays it through `load(source:)`. `--memory` reads via `DataIOReader`, `--forward-only` drops the seek capability, `--audio-only` routes through the audio-only pipeline, and `--reload` / `--switch-audio` / `--select-subs` / `--extract` exercise the optional capabilities (background reload, audio-track switch, embedded subtitles, scrub preview) end-to-end. `--audio-index N` names the audio stream at LOAD and prints what it asked for next to what it got. Pair it with `--forward-only` for the one question a live host has to answer: `selectAudioTrack` refuses such a source (rebuilding a drained FIFO), so naming the stream at load is the only way onto another track, and this is where that was measured rather than assumed (Sodalite#64).

## disc-inspect

Walks a local DVD-Video or Blu-ray ISO at the filesystem layer (FFmpeg-free) and reports what `DiscReader.wrap` makes of it: the recognition verdict and the stages it went through (ISO9660 / UDF signatures, BDMV / VIDEO_TS contents, resolved extents), so a disc that fails to play is debuggable instead of surfacing a bare `INVALIDDATA`. It also prints the full selectable-title list with each title's duration and chapter offsets (the same titles + chapters the engine exposes via `discTitles` / `discChapters`). Exit 0 when the image is recognized as playable, else 1. `--dump` adds the verbose UDF volume structure under the `.demux` log.

## dualsubs

Activates two subtitle tracks simultaneously on one source (primary + secondary) and prints both cue lists, exercising the dual / bilingual subtitle path. `--primary <streamIndex> --secondary <streamIndex>` select the tracks; `--seek <seconds>` jumps first so you can confirm both channels re-resolve after a seek.

## live

Runs a live MPEG-TS session against a built-in fixture that serves an endless broadcast by looping a seed `.ts` with rewritten timestamps. Flags simulate the failure modes the live path hardens against: `--drop-after N` (mid-stream connection drop + reconnect), `--discontinuity-at N` (program-boundary PTS / PCR jump), `--realtime` (1x wall-clock pacing), `--preroll N` (backlog seconds the paced fixture bursts before 1x pacing; default 30, `0` models a strict-realtime origin with no backlog), `--fast-zap` (loads with `LoadOptions.liveJoinProfile = .fastZap`; the first serve prefers the full holdback but is bounded after two finalized segments plus a 0.5...2.0 s observed-segment grace), `--dvr-window N` (timeshift), `--measure-rss` (sliding-window retention), `--reload-test` (live rejoin end to end, including the full-backlog replay shape some origins serve on reconnect). `--seed <ts>` overrides the seed clip, `--sw` forces the software live path, `--report-cache-bytes` tracks on-disk DVR footprint, `--serve-only` parks the fixture without attaching an engine (raw `curl` / `ffprobe` inspection), `--rewind-test` runs the DVR rewind-and-return matrix variant, and `--gen-highbitrate-seed` generates a ~22 Mbps 1080p H.264 MPEG-TS seed (for RSS-retention measurement) then exits. `--sliding` is still accepted and does nothing: the sliding window is unconditional for live sessions now, and the flag stays only so an older script does not fail on it.

## dvr

Runs the rewind matrix across the native and SW paths (`--path native|sw|both`). `--seconds N` and `--dvr-window N` size the run.

## hlsfixture

Slices a local `.ts` into a sliding live HLS playlist and serves it over loopback, with fault knobs (`--master` indirection, `--codecs`, `--resolution`, `--discontinuity-at`, `--slow-refresh`, `--drop-segment`, `--encrypted`, `--fmp4`, `--port`, `--segment-seconds`, `--target-duration`, `--window`) and a `--self-test` mode that runs `HLSLiveIngestReader` against it end to end. Every request is logged as one `[HLSFixture] REQ <path>` line, so what a load actually costs the origin is countable rather than arguable.

`--segments-dir <dir>` serves pre-cut segments (`ffmpeg -i in.ts -c copy -f hls -hls_time 4 -hls_flags independent_segments -hls_segment_filename seg%d.ts out.m3u8`) instead of byte slices, sorted numerically. Byte slices start mid-GOP, which is fine for "did it route" and useless for "did it play": the run rebuffers forever because nothing decodes. Use the directory whenever the question is playthrough.

### The advertised TARGETDURATION and the window depth (AE#374)

`--target-duration N` advertises a `#EXT-X-TARGETDURATION` independent of the real cut size, and `--window N` sets how many segments the sliding window keeps visible (default 6, minimum 3). Packagers commonly pad the target duration (`segment + 1`) to widen a client's patience for an unchanged playlist, and a downstream host asked whether that padding was what its live joins were paying for. Neither shape could be expressed here, so the question could not be answered by measurement at all.

Measured against pre-cut GOP-aligned segments, `play --live --fast-zap` entered on a saturated window, three passes per row, engine 6.34.1:

| origin cut | advertised TD | window | served TD | first serve held |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2 s | 3 (padded) | 3 | 3 | 2.004 / 2.010 / 2.010 s |
| 2 s | 2 (`ceil(max EXTINF)`) | 3 | **3** | 2.010 s, three times |
| 2 s | 3 | 5 | 3 | 2.001 / 2.007 / 2.010 s |
| 2 s | 5 (over-padded) | 3 | **5** | 2.010 s, three times |
| 1 s | 2 (padded) | 3 | 2 | 1.001 / 1.010 / 1.010 s |
| 1 s | 1 (`ceil(max EXTINF)`) | 3 | **2** | 1.005 / 1.007 / 1.010 s |
| 1 s | 2 | 7 | 2 | 1.003 / 1.005 / 1.010 s |
| 0.5 s GOP inside 1 s segments | 2 | 3 | 2 | **0.510 s, three times** |

Removing the padding changes nothing. The served TARGETDURATION is `max(advertised, ceil(observed arrival cadence), ceil(max own EXTINF), ceil(1.5 x cut target))`, and a strict-realtime origin's real inter-arrival gap is always a hair above the nominal cut, so the `ceil` lands on `cut + 1` whether or not the origin advertises it. Deepening the window changes nothing either: the ingest joins exactly three segments behind the edge at window 3, 5 and 7, so a deeper upstream window never becomes a deeper cushion. What moves is the cut, because the fastZap grace is `min(2.0, max(0.5, own cut duration))` and the engine re-cuts at the source GOP.

Over-padding costs somewhere else than the join. TD 5 on 2 s cuts still serves in 2.010 s, because the bounded fastZap exit fires on the grace either way, but the served playlist then carries a 15 s holdback, so AVPlayer targets that far behind the live edge for the rest of the session.

### The header-enforcing origin (AE#363)

A tokenized IPTV origin refuses anything that arrives without its per-request header, which is a shape none of the fixtures could produce, so neither live client could be driven against one:

```bash
# portal on 8099 answers /entry.m3u8 with a 302 to the "CDN edge" on 8100, both enforcing the header
aetherctl hlsfixture --segments-dir ./segs --master --codecs "avc1.4d401f,mp4a.40.2" \
  --resolution 1280x720 --require-header "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (QtEmbedded; TestSTB)" \
  --redirect-entry --redirect-port 8100 --port 8099
aetherctl play --live --header "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (QtEmbedded; TestSTB)" \
  --seconds 60 http://127.0.0.1:8099/entry.m3u8
```

The REQ log then carries the verdict per request (`auth=ok` / `auth=MISSING -> 403`), which is what makes "who lost the header, and on which hop" a measurement. Knobs: `--require-header "Name: Value"`, `--deny-status N` (401 and 403 reach the engine as different `NSURLError` codes), `--deny-segments-only` (refuse after readyToPlay rather than at the master), `--deny-user-agent S` (refuse `AppleCoreMedia` and serve everyone else, the one origin shape that tells the AVPlayer bypass and the engine's own ingest fetcher apart), `--redirect-entry` / `--redirect-host` / `--redirect-port` (portal-to-edge 302, cross-origin by host name and port while staying on loopback), `--media-origin H:P` (master's variants point at a second origin absolutely).

Measured with it before AE#363 was written, and worth knowing before suspecting the engine: `LoadOptions.httpHeaders` survive BOTH shapes on the AVPlayer bypass on macOS, the cross-origin 302 and the absolutely referenced second origin. Every request arrived with the header and the session played through.

`--codecs` / `--resolution` write `CODECS=` / `RESOLUTION=` onto both `EXT-X-STREAM-INF` lines. Without them AVFoundation reports no `videoAttributes` for the variants, so everything that reads master evidence (the #168 watchdog, the #293 probe gate) sees a master advertising no video at all and the fixture quietly stops carrying the case under test.

Note that the slicing is byte-based, not keyframe-aligned, so segments start mid-GOP and the decoder logs parameter-set errors on the rerouted ingest. That is fine for routing and plumbing questions; for a run that has to *play*, produce real segments with `ffmpeg -f hls` and serve those instead.

## seektest

Drives a real AVPlayer (native loopback-HLS path) through a burst of rapid seeks and reports the producer-restart coalescing behavior, the longest "wedge" (state `.playing` but the clock frozen), and final settle accuracy (AetherEngine#35). A concurrent sampler probe also checks the seek clock-bounce / `isSeeking` signal (AetherEngine#37 / #38): a single backward seek must not bounce the clock back through the pre-seek position, and `isSeeking` must span the real landing. The run ends with a `#38 SEEK EVENT LEDGER`: every `.began` must reach a terminal event (an unpaired one is a stranded in-flight window), and `.stalled` seeks are listed with any late `.landed` that followed them. `--seeks N`, `--gap-ms N`, `--settle N` shape the burst; needs `> 30 s` of seekable VOD. `--throttle-kbps N` caps source-IO delivery to simulate a slow CDN and force rebuffers during the burst (see `serve`).

## hlslive

Replays a synthetic SSAI ad-pod feed through the live-direct-play path to repro the FAST-channel ad-break handling (program-switch detection, muxer rotation with versioned `#EXT-X-MAP`, audio re-anchor, no-cut watchdog). `--segments a.ts,b.ts,c.ts` is required: a comma-separated list of real `.ts` segment files served in order (content / ad / content) without timestamp rewriting. `--seconds N` (default 40) and `--segment-seconds N` (default 5) size the run; `--disc i,j` marks which segment indices carry a leading `#EXT-X-DISCONTINUITY` (default: auto-detected on every file change).

## smbtest

Connects to an SMB2/3 share with `SMBConnection` (SMBClient backend), wraps the file in `SMBIOReader`, and runs a sequential-throughput pass plus a random-seek consistency check. macOS-only; needs the optional `AetherEngineSMB` product (`swift build --product aetherctl` pulls it in). Validates the SMB byte source without a device:

```bash
swift run aetherctl smbtest "smb://user:pass@host/share/path/to/file.mkv" --reads 128
```

`--reads N` sets the random-seek count (default 64). Credentials default to guest when omitted from the URL; URL-encode special characters in the password.

## Fixtures

For repeatable runs, `Scripts/fetch-fixtures.sh` generates a small set of synthetic FFmpeg test clips in `./Fixtures/` (H.264 SDR, HEVC HDR10, AV1, VP9) covering both the native AVPlayer path and the software fallback. Real-world DV / Atmos / multichannel sources go in `./Fixtures/user/` (gitignored).
